# RestPress™ – Arduino Prototyping Code

RestPress™ is a behavioral-science-inspired smart sleep prototype that delivers gentle, timed compression via electromagnetic actuation. This repository contains the *public-facing Arduino-based prototype code* developed as a proof of concept.

> ✨ This is a **technical demo only** — it does not represent final product code or contain proprietary algorithms or design specs.

## 🛠️ Hardware Used (Prototype Only)

- ESP32-S3 Nano board
- IRF520 MOSFET module
- 12V 5A power adapter
- 12V electromagnet (x2)
- Screw terminal to barrel jack adapter
- Lightweight non-metallic blanket

*Note: This setup is for prototyping and educational purposes. Do not use in consumer-facing products without electrical and safety review.*
